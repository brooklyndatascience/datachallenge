##Case Study

You've just been hired as a lead data scientist for a local company that buys and sells properties for corporate rentals in 
New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. The property acquistion team wants to better price its units, 
and they believe the listing data on Airbnb can be a useful proxy.

Your job is to help this team assess the variability in pricing across Airbnb listings in the targeted cities,
as well as discover any implicit relationships in the data. You will be required to to tell a story about the types of listings in these markets and 
identify any predictive patterns with which the property acquistion team can use for their deals.

###1. Data Scraping, Cleaning, and Normalizing
Using either R or Python, create an API that will pull, clean, and normalize all data that you deem relevant for a given Airbnb listing from each of the following urls:
  
  https://www.airbnb.com/s/New-York--NY
  
  https://www.airbnb.com/s/San-Francisco--CA
  
  https://www.airbnb.com/s/Los-Angeles
  
###2. Unsupervised Learning - Grouping, Dataset Reduction
You'll need to investigate any implicit patterns in your constructed data set and possibly seek to reduce its dimensions.

###3. Listing Price Prediction Supervised Learning

Once you have your clean data set, you will be required to create a supervised learning algorithm that predictes the price of an Airbnb listing in these markets
